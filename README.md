# Abstract-Class-Demo

NOTE-1: Implementation of the abstract method. We have to use abstract method because we inherit abstract class.<br>

NOTE-2: Abstract classes can't be instantiated. We can't create an object from Abstract class. This rule provides that every method of abstract class can't be reached out of this class. Only objects of inherited(extended) class can reach them.<br>
